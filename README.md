- Instantly display all tested links, with clear open/closed status
- **Automatically display WHOIS info** for the scanned IP (provider, abuse contact, etc.)
- Interactively edit ports to scan and timeout, **with settings saved between runs**

Perfect for quickly checking available web services on any network (work, home, clients...) and finding the proper abuse contact in one click.
